### Yet another off canvas navigation
Simple and lightweight attempt to imitate the navigations commonly used in a native apps in Android/iOS. 

### Demo
http://jessetinell.github.io/Off-canvas-menu

### Dependencies
hammer.js: http://hammerjs.github.io


### Usage
```html
<!-- Include hammer.js and offcanvasmenu.js -->

<div class="offcanvasmenu">
  <!-- Puv navigation here -->
</div>

<script>
    // Initiate the menu
    offcanvasMenu.Init();
</script>
```

### Current state
This only works well/smooth in Chrome for Android at the moment. I've quickly tested in Chrome for iOS and other browsers in Android, but it needs some improvements.
